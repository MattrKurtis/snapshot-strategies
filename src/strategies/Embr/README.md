The Embr Voting Strategy is designed to return the balances of the voters for the Embr token on the Binance Smart Chain. This strategy is useful for voting on proposals that require a minimum balance of Embr tokens to be held by the voter.

Here is an example of the parameters:

{
"address": "0x6CB8065F96d63630425fd95A408A0D6cD697C662",
"symbol": "EMBR",
"decimals": 18
}

In this example, "address" represents the contract address of the Embr token on the Binance Smart Chain, "symbol" is the symbol of the token ("EMBR" in this case), and "decimals" represents the number of decimal places used by the token. This information is used by the strategy to retrieve the balances of the voters for the Embr token.
